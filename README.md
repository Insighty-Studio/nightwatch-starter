# nightwatch-starter

This starter is configured to use Chromedriver.

It also comes with an example Nightwatch [command](http://nightwatchjs.org/guide#writing-custom-commands) which can be found [here](tests/commands/clickLinkContainingText.js) to get you started.

## Installation
Just run `yarn`.

## Running
Then run `yarn integration-test`.

## Common pitfalls
This starter uses Selenium jar from npm registry.
If you get a Selenium jar related error, double check that you have update the Selenium jar version in `nightwatch.conf.js`
